The back-end of an application that schedules speakers and sessions for a conference.  It was built using the Spring Framework with an MVC structure.  I built the application while following along with a tutorial from Pluralsight, "Spring Framework: Creating Your First Spring Boot Application" by Dan Bunker.

In order to run the application, open the app's directory in an IDE (preferably IntelliJ), locate the ConferenceDemoApplication.java file, right-click on it, and select "Run."
